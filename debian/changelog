ros-indigo-husky-description (0.0.2-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * Renamed /models folder to /meshes to follow the convention of other gazebo simulation packages.
  * Changed the base.urdf.xacro to use base_footprint as the parent frame. For some reason, the new Gazebo paints all parts the same color as base_link when base_link is the parent.
